        <p>
            Welcome to my blog! My name is Jack C (jakxc) and I am a Front-End/React Developer and 
            an aspiring Game Developer/Designer. I guess I can give you a brief outline of my background
            and also what I aim to achieve in the future. Finally, I will explain what you can find in this blog
            of mine and what I hope to deliver through it.
        </p>
        <p>
            I graduated with a Bachelor of Information Technology, with a major in User Experience Design. From about
            very young age, I have always been interested in fantasy worlds, in particular those created in games.
            I was an avid MapleStory player, which was one of the first introductions into MMORPGs and experiencing
            the possibilities of world building online. Aside from MapleStory, other MMORPGs that inspired my interested
            in development and design using code include Mabinogi, Runescape and Final Fantasy. This love for online worlds
            created within games coupled with my obessession with manga/anime (also very much tied to world building and creation)
            has brought me to this point: A developer in the pursuit of creating new things through code, whether it be apps or games.

            Through this blog, I will be publishing articles of that contain some valuable information I have gained
            through my coding journey that I want to share and hope that it helps other people as well. This information
            will range from how I learnt JavaScript and React, to delving into node.js and MongoDB. Anyway, I hope that
            introduction was not too messy and I hope you enjoy your stay.
